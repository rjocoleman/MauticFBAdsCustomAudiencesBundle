# Custom Audiences (Facebook Ads) - Mautic plugin

_(Formerly named 'MauticFBAdsCustomAudiencesBundle')_

The plugin enables integration with [Facebook Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads) and allows syncing its [Custom Audiences](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/341425252616329?locale=en_GB) with [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) segments.

_(The plugin was originally developed by [Raymond Muilwijk](https://github.com/rmuilwijk) and was sponsored by [Trinoco](https://www.trinoco.nl) for the [Qeado](https://www.qeado.com) project. **Without his fantastic work the project couldn't be available.** The abandoned project was forked and embraced by [LeadEngine](https://www.leadengine.hu/)/[ReachMedia Llc.](https://www.reachmedia.hu/) for further structured developments and maintenance. The project keeps its original [GPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license, therefore the project is freely used and developed ([source](https://github.com/d-code-ltd/MauticFBAdsCustomAudiencesBundle)). The new maintainer just tries to manage the processes.)_
